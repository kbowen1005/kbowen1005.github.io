					<h2>About Me</h2>
					<p>My passion for design goes all the way back to my childhood, where I was always known as the “artsy one”, slapping paint and stickers on everything I could find, including my first Yamaha guitar. I explored my creative side, first, with that very guitar, playing and writing original music. However, it was in college that I discovered my drive and desire to go into the field of graphic and web design.</p>
					<p>I graduated from the University of Kentucky with Bachelor’s Degrees in Business Management and Marketing, as well as, a minor in Fine Art Photography and Design in 2014. While I was still in college I interned with a local design firm, Fusioncorp Design, and continued to work for them after college, broadening my horizons designing websites and logos, as well as, learning to develop and code in HTML, PHP, CSS and JS. Come 2015, this Georgia girl finally decided to make the move back home and began my career with Barta Media Group specializing in brand development and web design. In 2018, I stepped out of my comfort zone yet again, and became the UI/UX designer and developer at Octane5 International with a focus on improving the user experience of their SAAS and rebuilding their iOS app. I continue to strive to grow and expand my skills, constantly researching the latest design trends, and expanding my development skills. With my eye for detail and out of the box creativity, I bring your ideas to life.</p>
